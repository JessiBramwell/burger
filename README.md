# burger

This application was an exercise in MVC architecture and an introduction to writing a custom ORM. It was created using Node.js, Express, and Express Handlebars. 

The functionality is quite basic. A burger can be entered and saved to the database. The list of burgers is printed in one of two column based on its "eaten" status. Burgers that have been un-eaten are displayed next to an "Eat it" button, which will update the "eaten" status from false to true and display the item in the correct column.

## Built With
* Node.js
* Express
* Express Handlebars 

## Roadmap
Later iterations of this project will store the name of the burger, the restaurant, and eaten burgers will be displayed with a rating.
